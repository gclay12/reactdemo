# React demo website

This project is to demonstrate my knowledge of the basics of react.  

In this project I demonstrate using react router for navigation and a few examples of react state and props and how they interact.  And how to use state to change css styles.

## How to use

run npm install to install dependancies. then npm start to run in development server.

## Front end development

Am very familiar with front end development.  I know html, css, and javascript, And I'm familiar with react.  

## Portfolio

Here is my porfolio website.  I made it with html, css, and vanellia javascript without using react. I thinhk it demonstrates my sense of design and that I understand more then the basics of front end development.  http://www.gclay.net/
